# Best practices for filterbanks

Filterbank can be tricky. I repeatedly saw improper practices of it even from the most experienced DSP engineers. Hence, Iâ€™d to share what I have learned and am keeping learning from my years of work experiences. The math and design tool are from [my paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8304771).  

### What is a filterbank

[This script](https://github.com/lixilinx/Best-practices-for-filterbanks/blob/main/what_is_a_filterbank.m) generates the following plot showing what is a DCT-IV modulated filterbank.

From top to bottom, we have 1) the prototype filter; 2) the four cosine modulation sequences; 3) the four modulated filters, i.e., element-wise products between the prototype filter and modulation sequences; 4) frequency responses of the four modulated filters. We see that these four filters cover the whole frequency range evenly, i.e., a filterbank. 

Here, I mainly focus on the DFT modulated filterbanks. Still, all these modulated filterbanks share the same math, and only diff by modulated sequences. 

### MIRROR symmetry if latency is unconcerned

### SAME symmetry if low latency is crucial

### Designs with lower aliasing do not necessarily performs better for tasks like AEC

### Squeezing synthesis filter does not help low latency filterbank design

### Spare that SRC
### Frequency shift on analytic signal only
